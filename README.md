# Welcome to the Cognisseum

Hello everyone. My name is JuryNullification (BS Computer Science), and I like funny molecules. 

I've made the Cognisseum to be a self-hosted digital garden. It is a knowledge base for harm reduction, organic chemistry, and chemical recreations.

## How do I use it?

The Cognisseum will eventually come complete with a packaged single-file executable. Right now, it is little more than a database that I'm putting together from many disparate sources. Eventually, it will have an environment for self-studying and social learning.

This is a huge passion project on my end as I begin to study for an MS in Chemistry.

# Roadmap
